# Dijkstra Path Planner
dependencies : numpy and opencv

1. choose point(radius: 0, clearance: 0) or rigid robot(radius: 3, clearance: 5).
2. Enter the x and y coordinates of the start location.
3. Enter the x and y coordinates of the goal location.
4. The optimal path will be shown in green once (if) it is found.
